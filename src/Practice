Practice Exercise
Guess Number Game
Use what you have learned so far to build a mini number guessing game.  Try to make the components resuable and practice the  passing of props.

Here're the basic requirements:
Set a mystery random number between 1 and 20 - you may hard code the number first.
User can input a guess.
System outputs status message to tell the user if it was too high, too low or if the user guessed correctly.

Challenge - Additional features you can implement:
User can reset the game to play again.
Programmatically generate a random number between 1 and 20 on start and when the game resets.
Display the past guesses.

This practice only requires the concepts you have learned so far i.e.
useState
event handling
passing props
component functions

Styling is not needed but you can improve the aesthetics if you have the time.
